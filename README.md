# binaryC-GRU-predictions

This repo was for a research project that predicts the S&P 500 using different types of RNN's. classificatoin.ipynb is where
most of the code can be found. Descriptive ReadME to be created after my finals. Research Paper included in repo, please
see for comprehensive dive into findings.
